# Electronics
Repo containing schematics, pcb, gerber, and other documents for the Electrical Team.

# Directories

## Getting Started
Simple projects meant to introduce members to hardware design

## Submarine
Contains revisions and files for PCBs meant for the Submarine

## Test Equipment
Projects involving test equipment for the PCBs built for the Submarine.

# How revisions work for the projects
Each project will contain a release and development folder. The release folder will contain the board revision that has been ordered, while the development folder will contain revisions that have not been ordered. 

Revisions will be decided by level of change with regards to schematics and pcbs. PCB layout changes and varients will increment by 0.1 and schematic changes will increment by 1. For example, if the power board required a layout change due to a bad route, then the revisions would go from 1.0 to 1.1 because the schematics remain unchanged. If the schematics requried to be redone due to supply chain issues, then the revisions would go from 1.0. to 2.0.

All project revisions should contain a file outlining the reason for the changes for documentation purposes.
