Follow this procedure before releasing files. Confirm every action with your initials and date. 
IF ANY CHANGES NEED TO BE DONE, START THE PROCEDURE FROM BEGINNING!

The procedure needs to be executed in order as defined below. Start from number 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Right click on the project -> compile PCB project
I confirm the project compiles with no errors:
Initials here:

2.	Run Design -> Update PCB Document
I confirm, there are no differences between schematic and PCB:
Initials here:

3.	Impedance (check design rules)
I confirm I have updated and checked the track width/gap to match the required impedance (e.g 55 ohm)
NOTE: Manufacturers have different track width/gap requirements.
Initial here:

4.	Run Tools -> Polygon Pours -> Rebuild All
I confirm, all polygons have been repoured:
Initial here:

5.	Run Tools -> Design Rule Check -> Run Design Rule Check
I confirm, I have checked the Design Rule Output File:
Initial here:

6.	Gerber Check
I confirm I have copied and visually checked gerber files placed in \PCB manufacturing\Gerber Output\...
NOTE: the outline of the board must be manually drawn on one of the mechanical layers.
Initial here:

7.	Other Files:
I confirm I have copied and checked files placed in PCB manufacturing\...
Initial here:

8.	Order PCB:
I confirm the PCB has been ordered.
Initial here:
